# Tracer-based Rapid Anthropogenic Carbon Estimation (TRACE)
Python version 0.2-.0 (beta)

[![Python application](https://github.com/d-sandborn/pyTRACE/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/d-sandborn/pyTRACE/actions/workflows/python-app.yml) 
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/931694885.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15597122)

After [TRACEv1](https://github.com/BRCScienceProducts/TRACEv1) and being developed in parallel with [ESPER](https://github.com/BRCScienceProducts/ESPER) and [PyESPER](https://github.com/LarissaMDias/PyESPER). Please reference the TRACEv1 [publication](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-17-3073-2025) for further details.

This code generates estimates of ocean anthropogenic carbon content from user-supplied inputs of coordinates (lon, lat, depth), salinity, temperature, and year. Information is also needed about the historical and/or future atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> trajectory.  This information can be provided or default values can be assumed.  This tool is a multi-platform implementation of the inverse gaussian transit time distribution method aimed at increasing the accessibility of ocean anthropogenic carbon content estimation.

## Setup

Clone TRACE to your machine or download and unzip a [release](https://github.com/d-sandborn/pyTRACE/releases).  Ensure pip and python are installed in a virtual environment (we suggest [this method](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html)). pyTRACE can then be installed (as an editable install) by navigating to the unzipped directory of TRACE and running the following command in a terminal emulator
```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```
TRACE is not yet available via pypy or conda, but this is a target for future development if interest warrants it. Additionally, PyCO2SYS >= v2 is required for speed and stability purposes. Instructions to install the newest public beta for that package can be found [here](https://mvdh.xyz/PyCO2SYS/).

## Use

Call TRACE within a Python script or iPython console by running 

```python
from pyTRACE import trace
```

which will make available the top-level function for anthropogenic carbon estimation. For details on its input and output parameters, run

```python
?trace
```

To estimate anthropogenic carbon (C<sub>anth</sub>) at the surface ocean at the equator/prime meridian in the years 2000 and 2200 assuming IPCC pathway SSP5_3.4_over:

```python
output = trace(
    output_coordinates=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),
    dates=np.array([2000, 2200]),
    predictor_measurements=np.array([[35, 20], [35, 20]]),
    predictor_types=np.array([1, 2]),
    atm_co2_trajectory=9
)
```

which returns an [xarray dataset](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/generated/xarray.Dataset.html) containing C<sub>anth</sub> at the specified dates and times, its uncertainties, and associated metadata. More examples can be found in the ```demos``` folder. Attributes of the [CF-compliant](https://cfconventions.org/) dataset describe the variables and their units.

```

This result above agrees with TRACEv1, which gives C<sub>anth</sub> = ```[47.7869 79.8749]``` for the same inputs.

Calling ```trace``` without a temperature input will cause it to estimate temperature from salinity and coordinates via a neural network. This is **not** recommended, but will yield results (with a warning) as in TRACEv1:

```python
output = trace(
    output_coordinates=np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),
    dates=np.array([2000, 2010]),
    predictor_measurements=np.array([[35], [35]]),
    predictor_types=np.array([1]),
    atm_co2_trajectory=1
)

UserWarning: Temperature is being estimated from salinity and coordinate information.
